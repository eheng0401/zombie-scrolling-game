Project 02: Zombie Apocalypse


This game is a Zombie Apocalypse game. The player must collect food for 1 point and avoid zombie entities that do 1 damage to the player's HP. Collecting rare health packs increases your points by 3 as well as your HP by 1. The additional game mechanics added to this game are the different levels and types of avoids in the game. There are three levels/days of the apocalypse. The first level has similar settings to Basic Game. The second level has the zombies moving at a faster speed while the scrolling speed of the other entities remains the same. The third level has zombies that move at the same speed as the first level but some 'toxic waste' in the air, which is much faster avoid entity. The player must collect 50 points to advance to the next level. The game ends if the player dies at any of the levels.
